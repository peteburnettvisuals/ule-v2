        <Lesson id="CAT-GEAR-01" name="The Parachute Rig" desc="Includes the dual canopy system, main ripcord and reserve handle.">
			Teaching Content for this lesson:
			- Dual canopy system: explain that the rig has a main and reserve. These should be inspected yearly.
            - Main Ripcord: Explain what it does. Located right side, chest height. Pull outwards with right-hand, not crossbody.
			- Reserve Handle: Silver Handle, Located left side, hip height.
			Visual Resources for this lesson:

            - [[CAT-GEAR-01_chute_handles.jpg]] Diagram of parachute focussing on handle colour and location.
			Test Scenario
			 - The student is at the dropzone, and they are given a new parachute. What should they check for, and where will they find it?

        <Lesson id="CAT-GEAR-02" name="Altimeter &amp; Height Windows" desc="Tools and techniques for descent management">
            Teaching Content for this lesson:
			- Check Cadence: We need to be checking our altimeter every 5 seconds during freefall
			- Correct Setting For Drop Zone: Always set Altimeter so that zero matches dropzone elevation.
			- Decision Window: 5,000ft AGL is the start of the Decision Window, reaching down to 3,000 feet
			- Mandatory Deployment Altitude: 3,000ft AGL. Essential parachute is deployed to allow time to reserve deployment in case of failure.
            Visual Resources for this lesson:
			- [[CAT-GEAR-02_altimeter_example.jpg]] - Example image of a wrist altimeter.
			- [[CAT-GEAR-02_decision_window.jpg]] - Diagram of the decision window, showing altitude heights.
            Test Scenario
            - The student is at 6,000 feet. What are their actions over the next few seconds?

    <Module name="M2: Environment" id="CAT-ENV">
	
        <Lesson id="CAT-ENV-01" name="Danger Conditions" desc="Conditions which can endanger drops">
            Teaching Content for this lesson:
            - Cumulonimmbus: These clouds cabn be lethal for jumpers due to updrafts, turbluence, rain, hail etc. Jumping is prohibited if there are cumulonimbus clouds within 10 miles of the dropzone.
			- Cloud Cover: No boarding if cloud cover is below 2,000ft AGL
			- Max Wind Speed at DZ: Maximum ground wind speed at drop zone of 20 knots
			Visual Resources for this lesson:
             - [[CAT-ENV-01_cunim.jpg]] Ref Image of cunim (thunderhead) cloud formation.
			 - [[CAT-ENV-01_cloud_cover.jpg]] Ref Image of low cloud over dropzone.
			Test Scenario
			- The student is at the dropzone, on a cloudy and blustery day. What should they check for?

        <Lesson id="CAT-ENV-02" name="Water Landings" desc="The dangers and correct SOP for coming down in water">
            Teaching Content for this lesson:
            - Dangers of Water Landing: Landing in water is a dangerous activity. Jumpers has become cocooned in the chute fabric and lines and have drowned.
			- Water Landing SOP: Airborne Action: Unclip chest strap. Water Contact Action: Unclip leg straps only upon touching water. Reasoning: Prevents harness fall-out while avoiding cocooning.
			Visual Resources for this lesson:
            [[CAT-ENV-02_water_dangers.jpg]] Example image of a parachute in the water.
            [[CAT-ENV-02_water_land_SOP.jpg]] Diagram of the correct approach to a water landing.
            Test Scenario
			- The student is at 1,500 feet in a coastal location. An offshore wind is blowing. What are their actions over the next few minutes?
